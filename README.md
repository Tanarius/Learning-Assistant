## üîç Analysis Example

### Input: Your Job Bot Code
```python
import tkinter as tk
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import threading

class JobBotGUI:
    def scrape_job_posting(self, url):
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
        # Extract job data...
```

### Generated Learning Report
```
CONCEPTS LEARNED:

GUI Programming:
- Definition: Creating graphical user interfaces with windows, buttons, and interactive elements
- Your usage: Built desktop applications using tkinter with professional layouts, tabs, and user interaction  
- Interview answer: "I've created GUI applications using tkinter, implementing features like tabbed interfaces, background processing, and responsive user interactions."

Web Scraping:
- Definition: Automatically extracting data from websites and web pages
- Your usage: Built job posting scraper using BeautifulSoup to extract company names, job titles, and descriptions
- Interview answer: "I've developed web scraping solutions using BeautifulSoup to extract structured data from HTML pages, handling multiple site structures with CSS selectors."

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS GENERATED:

Q: Describe your experience with GUI development.
A: I've built desktop applications using tkinter, creating professional interfaces with tabbed layouts, background processing, and responsive user interactions. My applications include features like progress bars, multi-threaded operations, and organized file output.

Q: How do you handle concurrent operations in your applications?  
A: I implement threading to prevent GUI freezing during long operations like API calls. My applications use background threads for network requests while keeping the user interface responsive.

NEXT LEARNING STEPS:
1. Advanced GUI Frameworks - Learn PyQt for more sophisticated applications
2. API Development - Learn Flask/FastAPI to build your own APIs  
3. Database Integration - Add persistent data storage to your applications

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Code Analysis Pipeline
```python
# 1. File Discovery
python_files = Path(directory).glob("*.py")

# 2. AST Parsing  
tree = ast.parse(file_content)
for node in ast.walk(tree):
    # Extract imports, classes, functions, patterns

# 3. Concept Mapping
concepts = map_imports_to_concepts(imports)
patterns = identify_programming_patterns(code)

# 4. Learning Material Generation
explanations = generate_concept_explanations(concepts)
questions = generate_interview_prep(patterns)
```

### Intelligence Features
- **Concept Database:** Maps 50+ imports to programming concepts
- **Pattern Library:** Recognizes common architectural patterns  
- **Interview Bank:** 100+ questions based on different skill combinations
- **Learning Paths:** Structured progression recommendations

### Analysis Scope
```python
SUPPORTED_ANALYSIS:
- Python imports and library usage
- Class and function definitions  
- Programming patterns (GUI, API, threading, etc.)
- Architectural decisions and complexity
- Error handling and best practices
- Documentation and code organization
```
